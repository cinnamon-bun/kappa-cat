# kappa-cat

```
Print each message from a kappa-core multifeed.

Note that hypercores can only be used by one local process at a time, so
best to quit other kappa-core programs before running this one.

--pretty     Pretty-print the json on multiple lines.
$LOCAL_PATH  Path to local folder where kappa-core data is stored.
             Might be ~/.cabal/archives/YOURKEY or ~/.cabal-desktop/YOURKEY
```
